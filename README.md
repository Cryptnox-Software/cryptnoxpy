`cryptnox_sdk_py` is a Python 3 library used to communicate with the **Cryptnox Smartcard Applet**.
It provides a high-level API to manage Cryptnox Hardware Wallet Cards, including initialization,
secure channel setup, seed management, and cryptographic signing.

---

## Supported hardware

- **Cryptnox smart cards** 💳
- **Standard PC/SC smart card readers**: either USB NFC reader or a USB smart card reader
  → Readers are also available in the Cryptnox shop.

Get your cards and readers here: [shop.cryptnox.com](https://shop.cryptnox.com)

---

## Features

- Establish communication with Cryptnox smart cards
- Initialize and manage card lifecycle
- Secure channel authentication and pairing
- Seed generation and restoration (BIP32 / BIP39 compatibility)
- ECDSA secp256k1 signing for blockchain applications

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install cryptnox_sdk_py
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cryptnox-Software/cryptnox_sdk_py.git
pip install .
```

Requires:
- Python 3.11–3.13
- PC/SC Smart Card service (`pcscd`) on Linux

On Linux, ensure the PC/SC service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl start pcscd
sudo systemctl enable pcscd
```

---

## Quick usage examples

### 1. Connect to a Cryptnox Card

```python
import cryptnox_sdk_py
from cryptnox_sdk_py import exceptions

connection = None
try:
    connection = cryptnox_sdk_py.Connection(0)
    card = cryptnox_sdk_py.factory.get_card(connection)
    # Card is loaded and can be used
    print(f"Card serial number: {card.serial_number}")
except exceptions.ReaderException:
    print("Reader not found at index")
except exceptions.CryptnoxException as error:
    # Issue loading the card
    print(error)
finally:
    # Always close the connection when done
    if connection:
        connection.disconnect()

```

### 2. Test PIN code

In the PIN verification example below the card must be initialized before calling verify_pin.

```python
import cryptnox_sdk_py
from cryptnox_sdk_py import exceptions

connection = None
try:
    # Connect to the Cryptnox card first
    connection = cryptnox_sdk_py.Connection(0)  # Connect to card at index 0
    card = cryptnox_sdk_py.factory.get_card(connection)
    
    # Once connected, verify the PIN
    pin_to_test = "1234"  # Example PIN
    card.verify_pin(pin_to_test)
    print("PIN verified successfully. Card is ready for operations.")
except exceptions.ReaderException:
    print("Reader not found at index")
except exceptions.CryptnoxException as error:
    print(f"Error loading card: {error}")
except exceptions.PinException:
    print("Invalid PIN code.")
except exceptions.DataValidationException:
    print("Invalid PIN length or PIN authentication disabled.")
except exceptions.SoftLock:
    print("Card is locked. Please power cycle the card.")
finally:
    # Always close the connection when done
    if connection:
        connection.disconnect()
```

### 3. Generate a new seed

In the example below the card must be init before generating a seed.

```python
import binascii
import cryptnox_sdk_py
from cryptnox_sdk_py import exceptions

PIN = "1234"  # or "" if the card was opened via challenge-response

def main():
    connection = None
    try:
        connection = cryptnox_sdk_py.Connection(0)
        card = cryptnox_sdk_py.factory.get_card(connection)
        
        seed_uid = card.generate_seed(PIN)
        # seed_uid is of type bytes: display in hex for readability
        print("Seed (primary node m) UID:", binascii.hexlify(seed_uid).decode())
    except exceptions.ReaderException:
        print("Reader not found at index")
    except exceptions.CryptnoxException as err:
        print(f"Error loading card: {err}")
    except exceptions.KeyAlreadyGenerated:
        print("A seed is already generated on this card.")
    except exceptions.KeyGenerationException as err:
        print(f"Failed to generate seed: {err}")
    finally:
        # Always close the connection when done
        if connection:
            connection.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
