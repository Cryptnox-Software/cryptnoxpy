# Commercial license

`cryptnox-sdk-py` is distributed under a dual-licensing model:

- **GNU LGPLv3**
- **Commercial license**

The following sections define the applicable licensing conditions.

---

## When a commercial license is required

A commercial license is required in the following situations:

- When the SDK is used in a manner that does not comply with the terms of the LGPLv3  
- When the SDK is bundled, embedded, or distributed in conditions that prevent users from replacing or updating the library  
- When modifications to the SDK are made and the publisher does not wish to release these modifications as required under the LGPLv3  
- When a proprietary licensing framework, commercial guarantees, or dedicated support are required

For standard Python usage through regular imports, the LGPLv3 terms generally permit integration into proprietary software, provided all conditions of the license are strictly met.

---

## Scope of the commercial license

The commercial license provides the following rights:

- Use of `cryptnox-sdk-py` without any obligation imposed by the LGPLv3  
- Distribution or embedding of the SDK under any technical, commercial, or contractual conditions  
- Internal modification of the SDK without publication requirements  
- Exemption from all obligations related to library replacement, user relinking, or source availability  
- Access to optional contractual services such as support, maintenance, or warranties

---

## Use under LGPLv3

The SDK may be used under the LGPLv3 provided that:

- The terms of the LGPLv3 are fully respected  
- The SDK remains a distinct and replaceable component within the application  
- Copyright, notices, and license terms are preserved  
- Modifications to the SDK itself are published in accordance with the license

These conditions apply to both open-source and proprietary software.
