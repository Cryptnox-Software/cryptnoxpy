# Commercial license

`cryptnox-sdk-py` is distributed under a dual-licensing model:

- GNU GPLv3 (open-source)
- Commercial license (for proprietary or non-GPL use)

This document explains when a commercial license is required and what it provides.

---

## When do you need a commercial license?

You must obtain a commercial license if:

- Your software is proprietary or closed-source
- Your software uses a license incompatible with GPLv3 (MIT, BSD, Apache, LGPL, commercial, etc.)
- You want to embed or distribute the SDK in a commercial product without GPL obligations
- You do not wish to release your tool or application under GPLv3

If your project uses any other license than GPLv3, you need a commercial license.

---

## What the commercial license allows

With a commercial license, you are allowed to:

- Use `cryptnox-sdk-py` in closed-source or proprietary applications
- Release your software under any license you choose
- Distribute commercial products without revealing your source code
- Modify the SDK internally without being required to publish changes
- Avoid all GPLv3 copyleft requirements

The commercial license provides full freedom for professional and enterprise use.

---

## What remains free under GPLv3

You can use the SDK under GPLv3 if:

- Your project is GPLv3-licensed
- Your entire application (including distributed source) is GPLv3-compatible
- You accept the GPL copyleft obligations

Commercial use is allowed under GPLv3 as long as the software remains GPLv3.

Using the SDK in any non-GPLv3 software without a commercial license violates the GPLv3 terms.  
A commercial license provides an alternative legal framework that replaces GPL obligations for your specific usage.
